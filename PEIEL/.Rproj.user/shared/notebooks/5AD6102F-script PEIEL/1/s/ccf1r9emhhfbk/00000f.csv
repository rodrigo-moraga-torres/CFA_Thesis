"0","#El análisis factorial confirmatorio del modelo bidimensional de la escala PEIEL mostró un ajuste excelente a los datos, χ²(8) = 15.36, p = .052, CFI = .995, TLI = .991, RMSEA = .045 [IC90% .00–.078], SRMR = .019. Todas las cargas factoriales fueron elevadas y significativas (p < .001), y los dos factores correlacionaron positivamente (r = .72, p < .001), confirmando una estructura de dos dimensiones interrelacionadas de desigualdad percibida: acceso a bienes y servicios y adversidad financiera."
