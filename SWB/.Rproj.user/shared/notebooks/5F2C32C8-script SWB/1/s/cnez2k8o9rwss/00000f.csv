"0","#El análisis factorial confirmatorio de la escala SWB respaldó su estructura unidimensional. El modelo presentó un ajuste adecuado (χ²(5) = 15.38, p = .009; CFI = 0.992; TLI = 0.984; RMSEA = 0.061, IC90% [0.028–0.096]; SRMR = 0.018). Todas las cargas factoriales fueron altas y significativas (0.84–1.12), indicando que los ítems contribuyen de manera consistente al factor latente. En conjunto, los resultados confirman la validez factorial de la escala de Bienestar Subjetivo."
